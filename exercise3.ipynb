    "You are now employed as a security engineer in AutoCAR. Your task is to secure the network against attacks, both with malicious intent and random failures. Here it will be important to analyse the network, find low-hanging fruits and add extra edges redundancy where needed, without increasing the cost too much. Use the methods you learned in the exercise so far to analyse and secure the network. Explain your choices and link it to the non-funtional requirements (security, dependability, performance, etc.). Deduce consequences that result if malicious agents obtain information about your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis should show a thorough understanding of graph theory and graph theoretical structural analysis. Your use of relevant notions will be especially considered during assessment. The task should be answered in a concise manner and comprise a maximum of 800 word. Begin the task with showing a picture of the network and reference to figures, histograms and graphs as to how you want to secure the network. Start the task with a picture of the network. Use figures, histograms and graphs to show how and why you would secure the network. Are there any nodes that are more important to secure than others? Investigate the question by adding redundancy and run attacks to assess the effectivness of your measures. Use <code>get_attack_graph()</code>. Propose how the network can be better secured agains atacks and random fails based on yout findings. \n",
